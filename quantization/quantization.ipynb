    "Next, we should implement and validate the midtread quantizer.\n",
    "We do this with two approaches. `uniform_midtread_quantizer` follows the lecture and thus directly the calculation of the quantization model. `my_quant` is a more intuitive approach using `round` rather than `floor`. \n",
    "\n",
    "They differentiate slightly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `uniform_midtread_quantizer` always exhibits odd number of quantization steps\n",
    "- Both quantization functions saturate $x<-1$ towards $x_q = -1$\n",
    "- `uniform_midtread_quantizer` saturates $x>+1$ towards $x_q = +1$\n",
    "- In the case of an odd number of quantization steps, `my_quant`  saturates $x>+1$ towards $x_q = +1$\n",
    "- In the case of an even number of quantization steps, `my_quant` saturates $x>1-2^{-B}$ towards $x_q = 1-2^{-(B-1)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last case is used for AD and DA converters, since it is meaningful to code an even number of conditions with bits.\n",
    "Said differently: the number range convention for analog/digital (AD) and digital/analog (DA) converters is $-1\\leq x \\leq 1-2^{-(B-1)}$ using $2^B$ quantization steps, $B$ denotes the number of bits, e.g. B = 16 bit for CD audio quality. Values outside this range will be saturated to their border values."
