A meaningful choice is the cut-off frequency of low- or highpass filters or the mid-frequency of bandpass or -stop filters. This technique is known as frequency pre-warping.\n",

The single, real pole is given at $z_\\infty = -a_1$. It is simple to show, that for $f_c = 0$, the pole is at $z_\\infty = 1$. For $f_c = f_s/2$, the pole is at $z_\\infty = - \\frac{1-2/\\pi}{1+2/\\pi} \\approx -0.22203094070331453$.\n",
