    "# Parametric Windows: Dolph-Chebyshev, Slepian, Kaiser-Bessel Window\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous window types, all developed for special requirements. In the *DFT/Windowing* lecture / tutorial we've learned about two very simple and very often used **non-parametric** windows, the Hanning (or more correct termed Hann after the meteorologist 'von Hann') and the Hamming window. Non-parametric means that by desired window length $M$, the window signal and its spectrum are fully determined. In other words, if another spectral characteristics - very often you ask for other spectral resolution - is required, then the only variable to change this is $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hann** window is **not optimal**, since it does not use two of its potential zeros to shape the sidelobes of its DTFT spectrum. The Hamming window introduces two additional zeros to the Hann window to reduce the level of the first sidelobe.\n",
    "Note that the Hann window is still often used nowadays, not due to its non-optimum spectrum, but rather due to its simple calculation of the window signal $w[k]$ requiring only a cosine and weight of $1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So called **parametric** windows have additional parameters, that allow to meet certain constraints for a given overall design criterion. Two of the most prominent - in fact with these you probably can manage the majority of all windowing applications - are the **Dolph-Chebyshev** and the **Kaiser-Bessel** window. The Kaiser-Bessel window itself can be considered as an approximation of the so called **digital prolate spheroidal sequences** (DPSS, aka Slepian) window.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss these windows below in terms of their design criteria and the resulting additional parameter that can be set up to meet a desired constraint.\n",

In the days of its **invention by Kaiser** it was much easier to compute it than the digital prolate spheroidal sequences. This is due to the explicit given equation for the Kaiser-Bessel window, whereas for the Slepian window an eigenwert problem for a $M/2$ matrix has to be numerically solved. The Kaiser-Bessel window requires the [zeroth-order modified **Bessel** function of the first kind](https://dlmf.nist.gov/10.25) $I_0(\\cdot)$ to calculate the window signal $w[k]$. Thus, the given name in the DSP literature.\n",
