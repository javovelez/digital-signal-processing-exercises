    "There are numerous window types, all developed for special requirements.\n",
    "In the initial [DFT & Windowing](dft_windowing.ipynb) exercise and the detailed [DFT tutorial](dft_windowing_tutorial/dft_windowing_tutorial.pdf) we have learned about two very simple computable and very often used **non-parametric** windows, the Hann and the Hamming window.\n",
    "Non-parametric means that by desired window length $M$, the window and its DTFT spectrum are fully determined.\n",
    "In other words, if another spectral characteristics - very often we need higher spectral resolution - is asked for, then the only variable to change is $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hann** window is **not optimal**, since it does not use two of its potential zeros to shape the sidelobes of its DTFT spectrum.\n",
    "The Hamming window introduces two additional zeros to the Hann window to reduce the level of the first sidelobe.\n",
    "Note that the Hann window is still often used nowadays, not due to its non-optimum spectrum, but rather due to its simple calculation of the window signal $w[k]$ requiring only a cosine and weight of $1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So called **parametric** windows have additional parameters, that allow to meet certain constraints for a given overall design criterion.\n",
    "Two of the most prominent - in fact with these we probably can manage the majority of windowing applications - are the **Dolph-Chebyshev** and the **Kaiser-Bessel** window.\n",
    "These are optimum window designs.\n",
    "The Kaiser-Bessel window itself can be considered as an approximation of the so called **digital prolate spheroidal sequences** (DPSS, aka Slepian) window.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss these windows below in terms of their design criteria and the resulting additional parameter that can be set up to meet a desired constraint.\n",
